		<p> <span> Life </span> is complicated. My life is a perfect example. I am the second son of my parents. My elder brother Kamrul, who seemed quickly to get angry, was my best friend. My family was very protective and always tried to keep us far from the society. But my brother was always restless; he used to go outside and play cricket with friends. Sometime he even got into conflict with them. I was completely different from him, a quiet boy who loved to stay alone. Thatâ€™s why my family members loved me more.</p>
